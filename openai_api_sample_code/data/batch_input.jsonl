{"prompt": "What is the overview of the vision document?", "completion": "The vision document provides an introduction to the vision capabilities in GPT-4, including how it can understand and process images."}
{"prompt": "What models have vision capabilities?", "completion": "GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4 Turbo have vision capabilities, allowing them to take in images and respond to questions about them."}
{"prompt": "How can images be passed to the model?", "completion": "Images can be passed to the model by either providing a link to the image or by passing a base64 encoded image directly in the request."}
{"prompt": "What is the quick start guide for using vision?", "completion": "The quick start guide explains how to integrate vision capabilities into your application by sending image data in user messages."}
{"prompt": "What is an example of using vision in GPT-4?", "completion": "An example of using vision in GPT-4 would be asking the model to describe the contents of an image or to generate a caption based on the visual input."}
{"prompt": "How do you initialize the OpenAI client?", "completion": "You can initialize the OpenAI client with the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n```"}
{"prompt": "What should you keep in mind about the model's visual understanding capabilities?", "completion": "The model is best at answering general questions about what is present in images. However, it may not be as effective at answering detailed questions about specific object locations within the image."}
{"prompt": "What is the vision document?", "completion": "The vision document outlines how to use GPT-4 with vision capabilities, providing examples and best practices."}
{"prompt": "What are the limitations of the model's visual understanding?", "completion": "While the model can understand the relationship between objects in images, it may struggle with detailed spatial reasoning, such as identifying the exact location of objects within a scene."}
{"prompt": "Can GPT-4 with Vision be used for video understanding?", "completion": "Yes, GPT-4 with Vision can be used for video understanding, as described in the OpenAI Cookbook."}
