Assistant Tools Beta

Assistants created using the Assistants API can be equipped with tools that allow them to perform more complex tasks or interact with your application. We provide built-in tools for assistants, but you can also define your own tools to extend their capabilities using Function Calling.

The Assistants API currently supports the following tools:

File Search
Built-in RAG tool to process and search through files

Code Interpreter
Write and run python code, process files and diverse data

Function Calling
Use your own custom functions to interact with your application
