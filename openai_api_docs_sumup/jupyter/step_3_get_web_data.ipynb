      "Both of our new embedding models were trained with a technique that allows developers to trade-off performance and cost of using embeddings. Specifically, developers can shorten embeddings (i.e. remove some numbers from the end of the sequence) without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties by passing in the dimensions API parameter. For example, on the MTEB benchmark, a text-embedding-3-large embedding can be shortened to a size of 256 while still outperforming an unshortened text-embedding-ada-002 embedding with a size of 1536. You can read more about how changing the dimensions impacts performance in our embeddings v3 launch blog post.\n",

      "In this example, we discover four distinct clusters: one focusing on dog food, one on negative reviews, and two on positive reviews.\n",

      "FAQ\n",
      "How can I tell how many tokens a string has before I embed it?\n",
      "In Python, you can split a string into tokens with OpenAI's tokenizer tiktoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example code:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import tiktoken\n",
      "\n",
      "def num_tokens_from_string(string: str, encoding_name: str) -> int:\n",
      "    \"\"\"Returns the number of tokens in a text string.\"\"\"\n",
      "    encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding(encoding_name)\n",
      "    num_tokens = len(encoding.encode(string))\n",
      "    return num_tokens\n",
      "\n",
      "num_tokens_from_string(\"tiktoken is great!\", \"cl100k_base\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "For third-generation embedding models like text-embedding-3-small, use the cl100k_base encoding.\n",
      "\n",
      "More details and example code are in the OpenAI Cookbook guide how to count tokens with tiktoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\n",
      "For searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database. You can find examples of working with vector databases and the OpenAI API in our Cookbook on GitHub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which distance function should I use?\n",
      "We recommend cosine similarity. The choice of distance function typically doesn’t matter much.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\n",
      "Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in the identical rankings\n",
      "Can I share my embeddings online?\n",
      "Yes, customers own their input and output from our models, including in the case of embeddings. You are responsible for ensuring that the content you input to our API does not violate any applicable law or our Terms of Use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do V3 embedding models know about recent events?\n",
      "No, the text-embedding-3-large and text-embedding-3-small models lack knowledge of events that occurred after September 2021. This is generally not as much of a limitation as it would be for text generation models but in certain edge cases it can reduce performance.\n"
