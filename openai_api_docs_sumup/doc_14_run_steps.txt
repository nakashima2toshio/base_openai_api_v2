List run stepsBeta
get

https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}/steps
Returns a list of run steps belonging to a run.

Path parameters
thread_id
string

Required
The ID of the thread the run and run steps belong to.

run_id
string

Required
The ID of the run the run steps belong to.

Query parameters
limit
integer

Optional
Defaults to 20
A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20.

order
string

Optional
Defaults to desc
Sort order by the created_at timestamp of the objects. asc for ascending order and desc for descending order.

after
string

Optional
A cursor for use in pagination. after is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.

before
string

Optional
A cursor for use in pagination. before is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include before=obj_foo in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

Returns
A list of run step objects.
